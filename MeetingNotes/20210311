3/11/2021 Meeting Notes and Takeaways
Thanks to Talia Karim for keeping notes!

1. Trees: Need discipline specific trees to accommodate rock and mineral sample taxonomy (e.g., Dana and Strunz for minerals, or BGS).  
2. Determination: Need to be able to have ‘ranked’ determinations (similar to how a locality can have multiple collectors) for a single mineral or rock sample. One cataloged rock/mineral sample might be composed of multiple minerals. We need a way to record this.  
3. PaleoContext: Need to be able to record a paleo context for a locality/sample that spans chronostratigraphic and lithostratigraphic boundaries. Example… rock sample that spans a contact between two rock units and/or geologic time units. This would also be useful potentially for paleo collections more broadly and not just the geology discipline.  
4. Need someone to take the lead on the actual development.  
5. Data gathering from geologists who use these data. What are their needs beyond what we discussed? Future brainstorming meeting with the user group?  
6. Investigate other databases (EmU) who might already have figured some of this out. Can we repurpose what they have already done. Maybe setup another session with these folks?
