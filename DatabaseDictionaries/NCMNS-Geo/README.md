The NCMNS Geology Collection Database is a Microsoft Access-based application. The system is divided into two components using a split architectural design, allowing multiple people to interact with the underlying data simultaneously. The "code file" contains front-end logic, including all form and report objects. Underlying the front-end is a 'code file' that stores all of the collections data on a centrally located file storage device.   
Purchased more than 15 years ago, the system was initially engineered for the Ichthyology Collection. One by one, each collection adopted a modified clone of the original. By 2017, it was clear that the days of MS Access Database were numbered. A new solution to the management of digitized collections was needed. In 2018, the Research and Collections staff explored multiple collections management systems, eventually agreeing to move forward with Specify. Over the next year, the three Paleontology Collections (Invertebrate, Vertebrate, and Paleobtonay) and Non-molluscan Invertebrates successfully moved to the collections management software, Specify. The migration of the remaining biological collections is planned for 2022-2024. While Specify has worked great for the biological collections, Geology remains unsupported, giving rise to this project.  

When originally conceived, this project had two primary goals:  
1. A complete overhaul of the existing Geology Collections data model.  
2. Determine if Specify in its current form could be customized to support the Geology. Once the overhaul was complete, the Geology Collection could adopt Specify alongside the other eight Museum Collections in 2023-2024.  
  
After a few discussions with outside colleagues, the scope of the project quickly expanded to address two needs in the community:
1. Extend Specify to support Geology Collections   
2. A Standardized Data Model for Mineralogy/Petrology Collections.
